1. whats a script type?
i think: is a the actual form to declare components
teh real meaning:in Vue.js, script type refers to the <script> block in Single File Components (SFCs). The type attribute can specify how the script is processed, such as type="module" for ES modules or other preprocessors like TypeScript (type="ts"). Typically, the script block is used to define the logic, including imports, data, methods, and other options of the component.


2. whats define component?
i think: is older than script type and yo can declare components yo need to put the props and another things in there
the real meaning: defineComponent is a helper function provided by Vue 3, primarily used with TypeScript to define components with proper type inference and IntelliSense support. It helps structure components in a modular and typed way, allowing better integration with advanced tools like TypeScript.


3. which is better?
i think: is think they have a god thinks script type is less verbose than defien component but define component you can organize it first you need
the real meaning:his is subjective and depends on use cases. script setup is a newer syntax introduced in Vue 3.2, offering simplicity and less boilerplate, making it ideal for most scenarios. defineComponent is better suited for more complex setups, especially when using TypeScript, as it offers explicit type declarations and a more traditional structure.

4. whats rfc?
i thing: is request for comments and is the way of vue js request to teh users to the new functionalities and tehy decide if they put it on framework
the the real menaing is: RFC stands for "Request for Comments," a process used by the Vue.js team (and other open-source communities) to propose new features, changes, or updates to the framework. It provides a formal way for the community to discuss and refine ideas before they are implemented.
